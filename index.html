    <p>My name is Trisha Balani. I am a current first-year student at Syracuse University studying Policy Studies and Data Analytics.
        <br>I am originally from Aurora, Colorado, but I love the east coast. 
        <br>In my free time, I like to go to the gym, spend time with friends, go thrifting, paint my nails, listen to music, and try new foods.
        <br>On campus, I am a Policy Studies 101 UCA, and I am involved with Skills Win!, Connect 315, A&S/Maxwell Ambassadors, and Delta Phi Omega Sorority, Inc.
